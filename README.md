Netneutrality - one year review
===============================

One year ago we started the [NetNeutrality
Map](http://netneutralitymap.org) - a map displaying the status of
netneutrality in the world. It always displays data one year back - so
right now we have two years worth of data and we can ask ourselves: do ISPs
worldwide shape more or less.

This is a d3 visualization showing the percentage of shaped tests detected
in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013...
